# optimal-courses
A tool to find the optimal (shortest) course path given the following:
  1. Courses already taken / requirements already met
  2. Courses needed / requirements needed
  3. Possible courses (and information about them including what quarters they are offered, what requirements they can be used for, and how many units they count for)
